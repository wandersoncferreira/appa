# appa
Appa is a test runner for `clojure.test` which allow you to annotate tests with
`^:parallel` metadata to run the specified test in a
ThreadPool in parallel or in a dedicated ThreadPool by itself.

Tests not specified are run sequentially in a single dedicated ThreadPool.

See `demo/appa-demo` for the complete usage example.

Your test cases will become

``` clojure
(ns appa-demo.core-test
  (:require [appa-demo.core :as sut]
            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]))

(deftest ^:parallel test-1
  (is (nil? (sut/print-and-sleep 1))))

(deftest ^:parallel test-2
  (is (true? (sut/print-and-sleep 2))))

(deftest test-3
  (is (nil? (sut/print-and-sleep 3))))

(deftest ^:dedicated test-4
  (is (nil? (sut/print-and-sleep 4))))
```

And then you can call the test suite from the command line using:

``` clojure
clj -M:test --parallelism true
```

and the output

``` shell

Running tests in #{"test"}

or run it sequentially which turns this library into [test-runner](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner).

``` clojure
clj -M:test --parallelism false
```

``` shell
